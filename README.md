## Oystercard

### Specifications

Let's create a new Journey class, it should be responsible for starting a journey, finishing a journey, calculating the fare of a journey, and returning whether or not the journey is complete.

In order to be charged correctly
As a customer
I need a penalty charge deducted if I fail to touch in or out

Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.

 Update your test suite to reflect a new Journey class

 Create a new class Journey and move the functionality that relates  to a journey from Oystercard to Journey

 Make sure all tests pass, all existing functionality is preserved

 The #fare method should return the minimum fare (for the moment), or the penalty fare of 6 if there was either no entry station or no exit station.

 Make sure the entire codebase is DRY

 Make sure all methods are three lines or shorter
